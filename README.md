# trapControl
All files relevant to experimental control

Most of the code here is set up for working with a national instruments card and an Andor EMCCD camera, but the pieces which compose the experimental base (freqscan.py, run_gui.py, and experiment_base.py) could be modified fairly easily to support an entirely different experiment. A fair number of the files in this repository are only here for archival purposes- if it looks useless or unrelated to the main spirit of this project, it probably is.
